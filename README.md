## Cycling Analysis

According to Andrew Van Dam's work for the Washington Post's weekly
"Department of Data" column, the following 20 US cities with populations over
100,000 have the greatest number of bicycle commuters:

That got me thinking about how weather and other factors may impact workers'
decisions to ride a bike into work vs. driving. The census data is a nice
place to start, but weather over the course of the year isn't all that
compelling to look at. What if we could find data on daily bicycle usage?
Or better yet, hourly data?

I knew Madison had a pair of bicycle counters since I live there and ride my
bike frequently, but what about other cities on the list? Unfortunately, it
turns out most don't. And of the handful that do, some don't make their data
readily available (I'm looking at you, Portland). Thankfully, Seattle also
has several counters installed. So we'll just be looking at those two cities
and their corresponding hourly bicycle counts.
